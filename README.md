System Analysis and Design


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    DriverPass is a fictional company that provides driving instruction and preparation for people seeking a driver's license. They requested a system through which clients could purchase lesson packages online, book in-person lessons, and take practice exams.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I think I did an exceptional job assessing the system design requirements (technical, functional, and non-functional) from information given by the client via interviews.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If I could revise the UML use-case diagram, I would try to make it easier to read. I think as is, it's a little busy and doesn't have a natural flow for eyes to follow. I would try to retain the level of detail I've included while making it visually clearer.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The users for this project were both the DriverPass employees and their clientele. The staff needed ease of access to client accounts, especially the owner and IT tech. I accommodated this through using rights and roles to allow access safely and securely. The clientele needed ease of access to the company's resources. I accommodated this by allowing purchasing of packages without a user account,as well as presenting clear lines of action for other functions such as scheduling appointments and test taking. The user's needs are the most important factor in your system design because if their needs are not met, the design ultimately fails its intention and you have wasted the client's time and money.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    Determining the client's goals and objectives, the user's needs, and the project constraints will contribute to a strong foundation for any project. In the future, I think I would find ways to automate requirements gathering, as this tends to take up a majority of the time. I will also continue to implement UML diagrams as iterative documentation thoughout the analysis and design.
